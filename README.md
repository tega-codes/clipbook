ClipBook Project: The What & The First Week's Build Plan
📌 Project Explanation (Simple Terms)
What is ClipBook?
Imagine you're reading an article and find a cool fact. You want to save JUST that sentence, not the whole page. ClipBook lets you:

Highlight text on any website

Click a "Save to ClipBook" button in your bookmarks

See it appear in your personal collection (like a Pinterest for text snippets)

Real-Life Example:
Reading a recipe blog: Highlight "1 tsp vanilla extract" → Save → It's now in your cooking section

Researching for school: Highlight key quotes from 5 different sites → All quotes are in one organized place

Shopping research: Highlight product specs from different stores → Compare them side-by-side

Why It's Different:
Existing tools (like bookmarks or Pocket) save WHOLE PAGES. We save tiny pieces of pages.
